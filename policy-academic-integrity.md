# Collaboration and Academic Integrity

We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates, and you are welcome to work with other students on homework assignments. No matter what your academic background, you will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

Having said that, you must write up your own solutions and acknowledge the names of all collaborators
on the first page of your assignment or at the top of your code script. Keep in mind that you will not be able to collaborate on the exams.

Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the textbook/notes and go over the lectures and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staff. That way you will get the most out of the discussion. 

It is important to keep in mind the limits to collaboration. As noted above, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem solving. But you are not allowed to share your code or answers with other students. Doing so is considered academic misconduct, and it doesn't help them either. It sets them up for trouble on upcoming assignments and on the exams.

In addition, posting course content such as homeworks, projects, and exams on any 3rd party websites or submitting your own answers on outside sites/forums is considered academic misconduct.

You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others. Not only does such copying count as academic misconduct, it circumvents the pedagogical goals of an assignment. You must solve problems with the resources made available in the course. You should never look at or have in your possession solutions from another student or another semester.

When you need help, reach out to the course staff (come to OH, post on the course's discussion forum), in office hours, and/or during labs. You are not alone in this course. Instructors and staff are here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.

Finally, know that it's normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles even though many try not to show it. Even if you don't learn everything that's being covered, you'll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you'll have nothing to build on. You aren't expected to be perfect; it's ok not to get an A.

## Types of Misconduct

Students may be held accountable for committing or attempting to commit a
violation of _Code of Student Conduct_ or for assisting, facilitating, or participating in the planning of
an act that violates this Code (or an act that would be in violation of this Code if it
were carried out by a student). Violations include the following types of misconduct:


### Academic Dishonesty

All forms of academic misconduct or research misconduct, including, but not
limited to, cheating, fabrication or falsification, plagiarism, multiple submissions
or facilitating academic misconduct which occurs in academic exercises or
submissions. 

For the purposes of Academic Integrity, the following definitions apply:


### Cheating

Cheating includes, but is not limited to, the use of unauthorized materials,
information, or study aids in any academic exercise; the alteration of any
answers on a graded document before submitting it for re-grading; or the
failure to observe the expressed procedures or instructions of an academic
exercise (e.g., examination instructions regarding alternate seating or
conversation during an examination).


### Fabrication

Fabrication includes, but is not limited to, falsification or invention of any
information or citation in an academic exercise, including Fabrication or
Falsification of Research.

Fabrication of Research is making up data or results and recording or
reporting them.

Falsification of Research is manipulating research materials, equipment or
processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is
not accurately represented in the research record.


### Plagiarism

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the use of another person's work
(including words, ideas, designs, or data) without giving appropriate
attribution or citation. This includes, but is not limited to, representing,
with or without the intent to deceive, part or all of an entire work obtained
by purchase or otherwise, as the Student's original work; the omission of
or failure to acknowledge the true source of the work; or representing an
altered but identifiable work of another person or the Student's own previous
work as if it were the Student's original or new work.

Unless otherwise specified by the faculty member, all submissions, whether
in draft or final form, to meet course requirements (including a paper,
project, exam, computer program, oral presentation, or other work) must
either be the Student's own work, or must clearly acknowledge the source.


### Multiple Submissions

Multiple submissions includes, but is not limited to, the resubmission in
identical or similar form by a student of any work which has been previously
submitted for credit, whether at our institution or any other school, college, or
university in one course to fulfill the requirements of a second course,
without the informed permission/consent of the instructor of the second
course; or the submission for credit of work submitted for credit, in identical
or similar form, in concurrent courses, without the permission/consent of
the instructors of both courses.


### Facilitating Academic Dishonesty

Facilitating academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, knowingly
helping another student commit an act of academic dishonesty.


### Coercion Regarding Grading or Evaluation of Coursework

Threatening personal or professional repercussions or discipline against an
instructor to coerce the instructor to change a grade or otherwise evaluate
the Student's work by criteria not directly reflective of coursework.


###  Unauthorized Collaboration

Unauthorized collaboration means working with others without the
expressed permission of the instructor on any submission, whether in draft
or final form, to meet course requirements (including a paper, project,
take-home exam, computer program, oral presentation, or other work).
Collaboration between students will be considered unauthorized unless
expressly part of the assignment in question, or expressly permitted by the
instructor.


### Forgery

Forgery, alteration, or misuse of any University document, record, key,
electronic device, or identification, or submission of any forged document or
record to the University.


### Other Forms of Dishonesty

Other forms of dishonesty, including, but not limited to, fabricating information
or knowingly furnishing false information or reporting a false emergency to the
University.
