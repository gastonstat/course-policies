# Collaboration and Academic Integrity

We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates, and you are welcome to work with other students on homework assignments. No matter what your academic background, you will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

Having said that, you must write up your own solutions and acknowledge the names of all collaborators
on the first page of your assignment or at the top of your code script. Keep in mind that you will not be able to collaborate on the exams.

Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the textbook/notes and go over the lectures and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staff. That way you will get the most out of the discussion. 

It is important to keep in mind the limits to collaboration. As noted above, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem solving. But you are not allowed to share your code or answers with other students. Doing so is considered academic misconduct, and it doesn't help them either. It sets them up for trouble on upcoming assignments and on the exams.

In addition, posting course content such as homeworks, projects, and exams on any 3rd party websites or submitting your own answers on outside sites/forums is considered academic misconduct.

You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others. Not only does such copying count as academic misconduct, it circumvents the pedagogical goals of an assignment. You must solve problems with the resources made available in the course. You should never look at or have in your possession solutions from another student or another semester.

When you need help, reach out to the course staff (come to OH, post on the course's discussion forum), in office hours, and/or during labs. You are not alone in this course. Instructors and staff are here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.

Finally, know that it's normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles even though many try not to show it. Even if you don't learn everything that's being covered, you'll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you'll have nothing to build on. You aren't expected to be perfect; it's ok not to get an A.
