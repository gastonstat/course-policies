# Lab Policy

The following list of policies is orientative. Please keep in mind that the specific policies of a given semester are shared in the designated Learning Management System (e.g. bCourses, Canvas).

- Weekly labs are an essential part of the course and we will introduce concepts not necessarily covered in lecture.

- You must attend the lab section you are officially enrolled in.

- Lab assignments will be released every week, and their solutions will be posted on the LMS some days after lab discussion.

- You will have to submit the files of your lab assignment to the LMS.

- After the due date, late submissions will be accepted during a 24 hour period, and will receive a 20% deduction.

- Of all graded lab assignments, your lowest 2 lab scores will be dropped in the calculation of your overall grade.
